        <p>Remember: especially if you're having a nontraditional wedding, your nontraditional wedding invitation's wording needs to focus on minimizing confusion… because you're going to be maximizing disorientation. I vote for straightforward wording, with maybe one little piece of flair tossed in. Your wedding might confuse more traditional guests — don't let your invitation wording be confusing too!</p>
